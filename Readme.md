1. Lab_01: Probability Theory
2. Lab_02: Linear Algebra
3. Lab_03: Convex Optimization
4. Lab_04: Clustering Part 1 (Kmeans, GMM)
5. Lab_05: Clustering Part 2 (DBSCAN, Heirarchical)
6. Lab_06: Regression Part 1 (Linear (Univariate and Multivariate))
7. Lab_07: Regression Part 2 (Polynomial, Logistic)
8. Lab_08: Classification (KNN, SVM)
9. Lab_09: Dimesionality Reduction (PCA, LDA)
10. Lab_10: Naive Bayes Classifier
11. Lab_11: Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

The Folder contains the following files:
* Skeleton notebook file (*.ipynb)
